; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
; What it was written to find, which was written down before it was written
;
; docs/ideas.md predicted, before this file existed, that an editor would want
; **the size of the terminal** and find nothing to ask -- the one prediction on
; that list made about an absence already confirmed rather than guessed at. It
; is what happened, in the first hour, and it is why `system:terminalSize`
; exists (ROADMAP 6.34, closed the day it was raised).
;
; **The absence was never the interesting part; the price of the workaround
; was.** The number was always reachable, because `stty` prints it:
;
;   stty size through /bin/sh            7.0  ms an ask
;   stty size with no shell              2.3  ms an ask
;   the ioctl behind terminalSize        0.001 ms an ask
;
; 7ms is a fork, an exec and a pipe **per keystroke** for a program that
; measures every time it draws -- so this program measured once at startup
; instead, and a window resized after that was a window it drew wrong until it
; was restarted. Nothing tells a program the size changed: there is no signal
; here and there is no message that waits for one. **The cheap ask is what makes
; the missing signal not matter.** `screen:measure` now runs once per frame, at
; the top of the loop at the bottom of this file, and a resize is wrong for one
; frame rather than until the editor is restarted.
;
; And the second-obvious answer is worse than the first: `tput lines` down a
; pipe answers the terminfo default rather than failing, confidently and wrongly.
; `COLUMNS` and `LINES` are shell locals and are not exported, so the
; environment cannot be asked either.
;
; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
; What it confirmed, which had only ever been a warning
;
; **The escape key cannot be told from the start of an escape sequence** by a
; byte-level reader alone. examples/keys.sol said so and could only say it in
; the abstract: nothing had yet bound that key. A modal editor binds it to the
; most frequent action there is, and what it cost was this -- an arrow is
; `escape [ A`, three bytes, and `readKey` answers one, so an escape had to be
; followed by a read, and that read **blocked until the next key**. Press escape
; in insert mode and nothing happened; press the next key and both happened at
; once.
;
; **That is what `system:keyWaiting` is, and this program is why it exists**
; ([6.35](../docs/COMPLETED.md#635-a-read-that-gives-up--done)). *Is a byte
; coming within fifty milliseconds?* -- and nothing follows an escape that fast
; except a machine, so a false is a person pressing the key and the editor
; leaves insert mode there and then.
;
; `edit:pushed` is still what makes the other half right: a byte that turned out
; not to be part of a sequence is kept rather than thrown away. And **piped
; input has no timing in it** -- every byte is already there, so an escape is
; always read as the start of a sequence, which is exactly how this editor
; behaved before the message existed and is why its recorded transcript did not
; change by a byte when it landed.
;
; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
; Three smaller findings, none of them worth an entry
;
; **An array cannot have an element put into the middle or taken out of it.**
; `add` appends and `removeLast` pops, and a line arriving in the middle of a
; file is neither. `insertLine` and `removeLine` below rebuild the array around
; the change -- one pass over the lines per line inserted, which for a file
; anybody edits by hand is nothing, and would not be for a program editing a
; million-line file without a person in front of it.
;
; **`system:write` flushes**, so one call is one frame. A redraw that arrived in
; pieces would be a redraw you can watch happening, and the whole screen is
; built as one string here for exactly that reason.
;
; **A tab is one byte and eight columns**, and everything that positions a
; cursor holds both numbers at once. Every editor ever written has this; it is
; where most of the arithmetic in this file went.
;
; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
; Searching, which came a day later
;
; `/pattern`, `?pattern`, `n` and `N`, over the regular expressions in
; [lib/pattern.sol](../lib/pattern.sol) -- `.`, `*`, `[abc]`, `[^a-z]`, `^`, `$`
; and `\` to escape any of them. The library is the interesting half and says
; why it is shaped as it is; what the editor added to it was three things:
;
; **A file is not one string.** It is an array of lines and the cursor is a row
; and a column, so a search is a walk over lines rather than one call over the
; text -- and `^` and `$` mean the ends of a *line* without anybody deciding
; that they should. A matcher over the whole buffer would have had to be told.
;
; **Wrapping has to be said out loud.** A search that comes round to the line it
; started on looks exactly like a search that found something new, so both
; directions report the wrap.
;
; **A pattern that will not compile is a typing mistake, not a fault.** `/[ab`
; puts *a pattern has an unclosed '['* on the bottom line and leaves the cursor
; where it was; the alternative is an editor that dies of a missing bracket.
;
; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
; And replacing, which is the other half of the same day
;
; `:s/find/replace/`, `/g` for every match on the line, `:%s` for every line in
; the file, and `&` in a replacement standing for what was matched. The
; delimiter is whatever character follows the `s`, so
; `:s#/usr/bin#/usr/local/bin#` needs no escaping.
;
; **It is not `/find/replace/`**, and it cannot be. `/src/lib` is a perfectly
; good search for a pattern with a slash in it, so a bare `/a/b/` would mean
; deciding that certain searches are silently substitutions instead. vi put
; substitution on the colon line for that reason, and so does this.
;
; **The report is counted, not compared.** *17 substitutions on 9 lines*, where
; the number of lines whose text ended up different would be a smaller number
; and a wrong one: replacing `a` with `a` changes nothing and is still a
; substitution, and that is exactly the case somebody checks by hand.
;
; **`:%s` is the first thing here that can change a hundred lines at once, and
; there is still no undo.** What it has instead is the count, and `:q!`.
;
; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
; The grammar, which is the part worth reading
;
; **vi is not a table of keys, and an editor that implements it as one is a pile
; of special cases.** The notation is
;
;     [count] operator [count] motion
;
; where any of the three may be absent. With no operator the motion just moves;
; with no count it is once; and an operator standing where its own motion would
; go means whole lines, which is what `dd` and `yy` are. Everything else falls
; out: `dw`, `3dw`, `d3w`, `2d3w`, `d$`, `dj`, `dG`, `y'a`, `2yy`, `10G`, `3p`.
;
; So this file has **two dictionaries and one dispatcher**. A *motion* answers a
; place and moves nothing; an *action* does something. `edit:normalKey` decides
; which a key is, and whether an operator is waiting for a place to work over.
; Adding `e` or `f` later is one line in the motion table and no change anywhere
; else -- which is the test of whether the grammar was implemented or imitated.
;
; **The motions are the ones the cursor uses.** `dw` and `w` cannot disagree
; about where a word ends, because there is one `wordForward`: an operator runs
; it and puts the cursor back, which is what `placeAfter` is. That trick is why
; the table is short, and it is the reason the one bug this refactor produced was
; where it was -- see `clamp`, which had to learn that a *range end* may stand
; one past the last character of a line where a *cursor* may not.
;
; **A place carries how it should be read**: whole lines or a piece of text, and
; whether the character it lands on is inside the range. `dj` is two whole lines,
; `d$` includes the last character, `dw` does not include the first character of
; the next word. Those three sentences are the whole of why vi's deletions feel
; right, and every one of them is a boolean on `edit:place`.
;
; And one rule from the real thing, which is not decoration: **an exclusive
; motion that ends in the first column ends at the end of the line before it
; instead.** That is what makes `dw` on the last word of a line clear the tail of
; that line rather than dragging the next line up into it.
;
; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
; What it does not do
;
; No `U` -- vi's *undo every change on this line*, which is a different
; mechanism and not a level of this one. No `;` and `,` to repeat an `f`, no
; named registers -- one unnamed register is what `d`, `y`, `c` and `x` all
; write to and `p` reads. `J` joins without inserting a space, where vi inserts
; one and has exceptions about when. No line ranges beyond `%`;
; `:1,5s/a/b/` is a parser this has not got. Each of those is more of the same
; rather than more of the language, and this was written to ask the language a
; question rather than to replace anybody's editor. What is here is what it
; takes to open a file, move around it, change it and write it back -- which is
; enough to have edited this comment.
;
; It is held to a **recorded transcript** in tests/test_cli.c: a fixed screen
; size, a scripted stream of keystrokes, and the bytes it writes compared with
; the bytes it wrote when somebody last looked at them. `readKey` reading a pipe
; the same way it reads a terminal is what makes that possible at all.

; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
; The screen
;
; **Asked again on every redraw**, which is the only reason a window can be
; resized under this editor and have it notice. Nothing tells a program the size
; changed -- there is no signal to hear and no message to ask for one -- so the
; alternative to asking every time is a size read once at startup and wrong from
; the first drag of a corner. It is affordable because `system:terminalSize` is
; one ioctl; when this program was written it did not exist and the only way to
; the number was `stty size` through a shell, at 7ms an ask, which is a fork per
; keystroke and was measured rather than guessed. That measurement is what got
; the message built; the measurement is at the top of this file.
;
; Nil means the output is not a terminal -- under a pipe, or a test harness --
; and then the size is 24 by 80, which is a decision this program is entitled to

; Keys
;
; One byte at a time, which is what `system:readKey` answers. An arrow is three
; of them and has to be assembled; the escape *key* is one, and is told from the
; first byte of an arrow by `system:keyWaiting` -- a read that gives up, which
; the top of this file explains and this program is the reason for.

; PORTED, and this is where the terminal's hardest problem simply vanishes.
;
; The terminal read one byte at a time and could not tell the escape *key* from
; the first byte of an arrow, which is why `system:keyWaiting` exists and why
; `edit:escapeWait` is fifty milliseconds. GTK delivers a decoded key: Escape is
; "Escape" and an arrow is "Left". So `decode`, `decodeEscape` and `escapeWait`

; What each key does
;
; **This is vi's grammar and not a table of keys**, which is the one structural
; thing an editor of this shape has to get right: `[count] operator [count]
; motion`, where the operator may be absent (and then the motion just moves),
; the count may be absent, and `dd` is the operator standing in for its own
; motion. `dw`, `3dw`, `d3w`, `d$`, `dj`, `y'a`, `2yy` and `10G` all fall out of
; that; a table of keys would need a row for each of them.
;
; So there are two dictionaries. **A motion answers a *place*** and moves
; nothing. **An action does something** and answers nothing anybody reads. The
; dispatcher below decides which of the two a key is, and whether an operator is
; waiting for a place to work over.

; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
; A place
;
; Where a motion says to go, and how the text between here and there should be
; read. `linewise` is whole lines -- `dj` takes two of them, not the tail of one
; and the head of another. `inclusive` is whether the character it lands on is
; part of the range: `$` includes it and `w` does not, which is why `dw` leaves
; the next word alone and `d$` clears the line. `home` is for the jumps that
; land on the first non-blank character rather than keeping the column.

; Undo
;
; **A change is remembered by keeping the whole buffer**, which sounds
; extravagant and is not, because of one property of the language: **a string
; cannot be changed.** A line is a string, so a copy of the array of lines
; shares every line with the buffer it came from -- the copy is one allocation
; of one pointer per line, and the text itself is never copied at all. Editing a
; line makes a new string and puts it in one slot of one of the arrays; every
; other line in every other state is the same object it always was.
;
; That is why this is a stack of buffers rather than a list of inverse
; operations. Recording *how to undo a delete* is the design a mutable-string
; language is pushed towards, and it is a second implementation of every command
; -- one to do it and one to undo it, with the second one exercised only when
; something has already gone wrong. Here it buys nothing: the whole state costs
; a `copyFrom`.
;
; **What a change is**: one keystroke, except in insert mode, where everything
; typed between `i` and escape is one change. That is what makes `u` useful
; after typing a paragraph rather than infuriating. The boundary is drawn in
; `dispatch` -- a key arriving in normal mode closes the group, and the next
; thing that touches the text opens a new one.
;
; **Measured rather than argued.** Ten thousand lines of ten characters and ten
; thousand lines of a *thousand* characters snapshot in the same time --
; 0.095ms and 0.078ms, which is one measurement twice -- and a hundred times the
; text costing nothing is what sharing looks like from the outside.
;
; **`u` is a stack and not a toggle.** Real vi has one level and `u` undoes the
; undo; this keeps a hundred, and `ctrl-r` is the way back. The price is the
; array slots: a hundred states of a ten-thousand-line file runs under
; `--memory=16M` and not under 15M, which is sixteen bytes a line a state and is
; the cost of the simple design stated plainly rather than hidden.

; Repeating a change
;
; **`.` repeats the keys, not a description of them.** The other way is to
; remember *what was done* -- an operator, a motion, a count, some inserted text
; -- and do it again, which is a second description of every command that can
; change the text and a second place for them to disagree. Keys are the thing
; the editor already understands: feeding them back in is the same path they
; took the first time, so `.` cannot drift from what it repeats.
;
; **What counts as a change is what `undo` already decided.** `remember` is
; called by the three methods that alter the text, so it is the one place that
; knows; it sets a flag here on the way past. A command that only moves the
; cursor records nothing, and neither does `yy` -- a yank is not a change, which
; is vi's rule and falls out rather than being written.
;
; **The colon line is left out on purpose.** `:s/a/b/` changes the text and `.`
; does not repeat it, here or in vi: a colon command takes a line of its own
; syntax and can name a range, and repeating one with a single key would be a
; different feature wearing the same key. `&` is what vi offers instead, and it
; is not here either.

; **The delimiter is whatever follows the `s`**, so `:s#/usr/bin#/usr/local/bin#`
; needs no escaping at all -- which is vi's rule and is worth having the moment a
; path is being edited. `\/` inside a pattern is a `/` either way.
;
; **`/find/replace/` is not this command**, and cannot be: `/src/lib` is a
; perfectly good search for a pattern with a slash in it, and there is no way to
; tell the two apart without deciding that some searches are now substitutions.
; vi solved this by putting substitution on the colon line, which is where it is
; here.
;
; **There is still no undo**, and `:%s` is the first command in this editor that

; substitutions on 9 lines* -- and `:q!`, which is a coarse undo for anything not
